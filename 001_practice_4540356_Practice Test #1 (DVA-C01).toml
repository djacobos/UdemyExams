A = "CloudTrail"
B = "CloudWatch Metrics"
C = "X-Ray"
D = "CloudWatch Alarms"
Explanation = """
Correct answer - "CloudTrail" : With CloudTrail, you can log, continuously monitor, and retain account activity related to actions across your AWS infrastructure. It is a good tool for auditing and compliance purposes.

Incorrect:

"CloudWatch Metrics" - Its a monitor tool for example to monitor CPU usage of a particular EC2 instance

"X-Ray" - More appropriate for the application level as it helps with tracking requests made to your applications

"CloudWatch Alarms" - Used for watching a single CloudWatch metric and not API calls

A = "AWS::Serverless::UserPool"
B = "AWS::Serverless::Function"
C = "AWS::Serverless::Api"
D = "AWS::Serverless::SimpleTable"
Explanation = """
Correct answer - "AWS::Serverless::UserPool" : UserPool applies to the Cognito service which is used for authentication for mobile app and web. There is no resource named UserPool in the Serverless Application Model.

Incorrect:

"AWS::Serverless::Function" - This resource creates a lambda function

"AWS::Serverless::Api" - Describes an API Gateway resource. It is useful for advanced use cases where you want full control and flexibility when you configure your APIs.

"AWS::Serverless::SimpleTable" - Syntax for describing how to create DynamoDB tables

Question = "You are a developer at a company who creates the serverless functions in AWS Lambda. The functions are invoked by clients via AWS API Gateway, which anyone can access. Your team lead decides that it is time to control access and has requested you do that soon, using a 3rd party authorized mechanism. Which authorizer should you use?"
Correct = "A"
A = "Lambda Authorizer"
B = "IAM permissions with sigv4"
C = "Cognito User Pools"
Explanation = """
Correct answer - "Lambda Authorizer" : An Amazon API Gateway Lambda authorizer (formerly known as a custom authorizer) is a Lambda function that you provide to control access to your API. A Lambda authorizer uses bearer token authentication strategies, such as OAuth or SAML. Before creating an API Gateway Lambda authorizer, you must first create the AWS Lambda function that implements the logic to authorize and, if necessary, to authenticate the caller.

Incorrect:

"IAM permissions with sigv4" - You will still need to provide permissions but our requirements have need for 3rd party authentication which is where Lambda Authorizer comes in to play

"Cognito User Pools" - This is managed by AWS therefore does not meet our requirements

Which of the following services should you use given these requirements?"
Correct = "A"
A = "DynamoDB"
B = "RDS"
C = "Redshift"
D = "ElastiCache"
Explanation = """
Correct answer - "DynamoDB" : Amazon DynamoDB is a no relational database that delivers reliable performance at any scale. It is a fully managed, multi-region, multi-master database that provides consistent single-digit millisecond latency.

Incorrect:

"RDS" - Its use for relational storage and not NoSQL

"Redshift" - Redshift is a petabyte scale warehouse service and you have to manually change settings for scaling

"ElastiCache" - Good for in-memory caching and helps significantly improve latency

A = "Use the Encryption SDK"
B = "KMS Encrypt API Call"
C = "S3 Encrypt API Call"
D = "IAM Encrypt API call"
Explanation = """
Correct answer - "Use the Encryption SDK" : The AWS Encryption SDK is an encryption library that helps make it easier for you to implement encryption best practices in your application.

Incorrect:

"KMS Encrypt API Call" - Although you might use it to encrypt small amounts of data, such as a password or RSA key, they are not designed to encrypt application data, especially in this size amount

"S3 Encrypt API Call" - You can encrypt data in your code using SDK but only can encrypt if storing objects in S3

Correct = "A"
A = "S3"
B = "SQS"
C = "AWS Lambda"
D = "EFS"
Explanation = """
Correct answer - "S3" : The Artifact Store is an Amazon S3 bucket that CodePipeline uses to store artifacts used by pipelines. When you first use the CodePipeline console in a region to create a pipeline, CodePipeline automatically generates this S3 bucket in the AWS region. It stores artifacts for all pipelines in that region in this bucket.

Incorrect:

"SQS" - A queue that lets you integrate and decouple distributed software systems and components.

"AWS Lambda" - AWS Lambda lets you run code without provisioning or managing servers

"EFS" - Amazon EFS is designed to provide performance for a broad spectrum of workloads and applications, including Big Data and analytics, media processing workflows, content management, web serving, and home directories.

A = "Check the Service IAM permissions"
B = "Check the CloudWatch Logs Policy"
C = "Also enable X-Ray integration"
D = "Ensure in-flight encryption is disabled"
Explanation = """
Correct answer - "Check the Service IAM permissions" : To enable CloudWatch Logs, you must grant API Gateway permission to read and write logs to CloudWatch for your account. The AmazonAPIGatewayPushToCloudWatchLogs managed policy (with an ARN of arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/service-role/AmazonAPIGatewayPushToCloudWatchLogs) has all the required permissions.

Incorrect:

"Check the CloudWatch Logs Policy" - There is no such policy instead you would create an IAM Policy to Access CloudWatch Logs

"Also enable X-Ray integration" - X-ray does not authorize API calls

Correct answer - "Kinesis Stream" : Kinesis data streams can continuously capture gigabytes of data per second from hundreds of thousands of sources such as website clickstreams, database event streams, financial transactions, social media feeds, IT logs, and location-tracking events.

"SQS" - Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) offers a secure, durable, and available hosted queue that lets you integrate and decouple distributed software systems and components

Correct answer - "Check the Service IAM permissions" : Any authorization related failure directly indicates to us that our first point of debugging should be validating the IAM permissions for the service.

Incorrect:

"Check changes in CloudTrail" - You can make changes related to storage of your files and receiving notifications but it does not affect authorization

"Check the recent changes in CloudWatch" - CloudWatch is a monitoring service therefore it does not affect authorization

"Audit the S3 bucket CORS policy where the artifacts are stored" - Cross-origin resource sharing (CORS) defines a way for client web applications that are loaded in one domain to interact with resources in a different domain. CORS applies to web and not for internal AWS service authorization

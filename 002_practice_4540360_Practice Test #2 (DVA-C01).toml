Correct = "A"
A = "Security Groups"

C = "The application is down"
D = "The ALB is warming up"
Explanation = """
Correct answer - "Security Groups" : Check your security group rules of your EC2 instance. You need a security group rule that allows inbound traffic from your public IPv4 address on the proper port.

Incorrect:

"IAM Roles" - Usually you run into issues with authorization of APIs with roles but not for timeout

"The application is down" - Although you can set a health check for application ping or HTTP, timeouts are usually caused by blocked firewall access

"The ALB is warming up" - ALB has a slow start mode which allows a warm-up period before being able to respond to requests with optimal performance. So this is not the issue

A = "Enable S3 and CloudWatch integration"
B = "Use AWS Lambda integration"
C = "Use CloudWatch Events"

Correct answer - "Enable S3 and CloudWatch integration" : If there is any build output, the build environment uploads its output to an Amazon S3 bucket. While the build is running, you can use the AWS CodeBuild console, AWS CLI, or AWS SDKs, to get summarized build information from AWS CodeBuild and detailed build information from Amazon CloudWatch Logs.

Incorrect:

"Use AWS Lambda integration" - Lambda is always a great way to use boto3 library to read logs programmatically but the work has been done for you with S3 and CloudWatch

"Use CloudWatch Events" - You can integrate CloudWatch Events with CodeBuild however since we are looking for logs only CloudWatch logs already has what we need

Correct answer - "The IAM permissions are wrong for the CodeBuild service" : Amazon ECR users require permissions to call ecr:GetAuthorizationToken before they can authenticate to a registry and push or pull any images from any Amazon ECR repository. Amazon ECR provides several managed policies to control user access at varying levels

"The ECR repository is stale, you must delete and re-create it" - You can delete a repository when you are done using it, stale is not a concept within ECR

"CodeBuild cannot talk to ECR because of security group issues" - A security group acts as a virtual firewall at the instance level and its not related to pushing Docker images

Amazon RDS supports the most demanding database applications. You can choose between two SSD-backed storage options: one optimized for high-performance OLTP applications, and the other for cost-effective general-purpose use.

Incorrect:

"DynamoDB" - RDS uses expensive joins which DynamoDB does not making DynamoDB a better choice for scaling by storing complex hierarchical data within a single item

"Redshift" - RDS is your best choice here but Amazon Redshift provides an excellent scale-out option as your data and query complexity grows

Correct = "A"
A = "blue/green"
B = "rolling"
C = "immutable"

Explanation = """
Correct answer - "blue/green" : As AWS Elastic Beanstalk performs an in-place update when you update your application versions, your application can become unavailable to users for a short period of time. You can avoid this downtime by performing a blue/green deployment, where you deploy the new version to a separate environment, and then swap CNAMEs of the two environments to redirect traffic to the new version at what ever point you want the traffic to be completely redirected to the new environment.

Incorrect:

"rolling" - Some instances serve requests with the old version of the application, while instances in completed batches serve other requests with the new version

"immutable" - Launches a full set of new instances running the new version of the application in a separate Auto Scaling group, alongside the instances running the old version

"all at once" - All instances in your environment are out of service for a short time while the deployment occurs

Correct answer - "Look into the X-Forwarded-For header in the backend" : The X-Forwarded-For request header helps you identify the IP address of a client when you use an HTTP or HTTPS load balancer.

Correct answers - "KMS encryption for data at rest & Encryption in flight with HTTPS endpoint" : Server-side encryption is a feature in Amazon Kinesis Data Streams that automatically encrypts data before it's at rest by using an AWS KMS customer master key (CMK) you specify. Data is encrypted before it's written to the Kinesis stream storage layer, and decrypted after it's retrieved from storage. As a result, your data is encrypted at rest within the Kinesis Data Streams service. Also the HTTPS protocol ensures that data inflight is encrypted as well.
